            <h3>Initial Inspection</h3>
            <p>To begin with, we inspect the structure of the dataset. The dataset comprises 18 columns and 149,116 rows, with various data types including integers, floats, and objects.</p>
            <pre><code>data.info()</code></pre>
            <p>Dataset Details:</p>
            <pre><code>Type: pandas.core.frame.DataFrame
Entries: 149,116
Columns: 18
Columns Breakdown:

 # | Column                | Non-Null Count | Data Type |
|---|----------------------|---------------|----------|
| 0 | transaction_id       | 149,116      | int64   |

dtypes: float64(2), int64(7), object(9)</code></pre>
            <h3>Column Removal</h3>
            <p>Some columns are redundant or less informative:</p>
            <pre><code>data.drop(['transaction_time', 'store_id', 'product_id', 'Month', 'Day of Week'], axis=1, inplace=True)</code></pre>
            <p>- Removed: `transaction_time`, `store_id`, `product_id`, `Month`, `Day of Week`</p>
            <p>- Reason: Columns like `transaction_time` are less relevant compared to `transaction_date`, and `store_id` can be replaced by `store_location` which is more descriptive. Similarly, `Month` and `Day of Week` are less useful than `Month Name` and `Day Name`.</p>
            <h3>Summary Statistics for Numerical Columns</h3>
            <p>To understand the distribution of numerical data, boxplots were generated for `transaction_qty`, `unit_price`, and `Total_Bill`.</p>
            <img src="assets/boxplot.png" alt="Boxplot for Numerical Columns">
            <h3>Checking for Missing Data</h3>
            <pre><code>data.isna().sum()</code></pre>
            <p>The dataset was verified for completeness and no missing values were found.</p>
            <h3>Duplicate Entries Check</h3>
            <pre><code>duplicate = data[data.duplicated()]</code></pre>
            <p>No duplicate records were found, ensuring the uniqueness of each transaction.</p>
            <h3>Date Format Conversion</h3>
            <pre><code># Convert 'transaction_date' column to datetime format and save cleaned data to a new CSV file
data['transaction_date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['transaction_date'], format="mixed", dayfirst=True)
data.to_csv('../data/coffee_cleaned.csv', index=False)</code></pre>
            <p>The date format was standardized for consistency, and the cleaned data was saved to a new CSV file named 'coffee_cleaned.csv'.</p>

        <section id="analysis">
            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>The analysis started with univariate analysis to assess individual variables. This was followed by time-series analysis to understand trends over time and multivariate analysis to explore relationships between variables.</p>
            <h3>Univariate Analysis</h3>
            <h4>Store Performance</h4>
            <p>By aggregating transaction quantities for each store, it's evident that the three stores have almost identical purchase distributions. This suggests that performance is balanced across the stores, with no standout performer.</p>
            <img src="assets/store_performance.png" alt="Total Transactions by Store Location">
            <h4>Items Purchased per Transaction</h4>
            <p>Most customers purchase one or two items per transaction. There's an opportunity to increase purchase volume through marketing strategies aimed at encouraging larger transactions (3-5 items).</p>
            <img src="assets/items_purchased.png" alt="Distribution of Items Purchased per Transaction">
            <h4>Product Category Purchases</h4>
            <p>Coffee and tea account for nearly 70% of purchases, while coffee beans, loose tea, branded items, and packaged chocolate only make up 2.81%. Coffee and tea are the most popular, while other categories are less popular. Consider promotional strategies to boost sales in less popular categories.</p>
            <img src="assets/product_category.png" alt="Product Category Distribution">
            <h4>Price Distribution by Category</h4>
            <p>Higher-priced items like loose tea and coffee beans have lower sales volumes. Products with lower prices and less variation in price are sold more frequently. Immediate consumption products sell more, whereas non-consumables or higher-priced items have lower sales volumes. There’s room for improving sales of less popular items through targeted promotions or pricing strategies.</p>
            <img src="assets/price_distribution.png" alt="Unit Price Distribution by Product Category">
            <h4>Drink Sizes</h4>
            <p>Regular and large sizes are more commonly purchased. Some drinks have missing size information, but it’s clear that 'Regular' and 'Large' sizes are preferred. The trend indicates that focusing on regular and large sizes could align with customer preferences.</p>
            <img src="assets/drink_sizes.png" alt="Sales Distribution by Drink Size">
            <h3>Time-Series Analysis</h3>
            <h4>Daily and Monthly Sales Trends</h4>
            <p>Sales and transactions show a general increase over time, with consistent dips at the start and end of each month. Sales are growing, with a noticeable increase starting from February. The positive sales trend suggests growth. However, more data is needed to understand annual seasonality better.</p>
            <img src="assets/daily_monthly_sales.png" alt="Daily Monthly Transactions Over Time">
            <h4>Sales per Transaction</h4>
            <p>Sales per transaction increase from the 21st to the 26th of the month, with fluctuations noticeable around the month's end and beginning. Sales per transaction show some periodic trends, but variations are minor. This suggests stable performance across different days of the month.</p>
            <img src="assets/sales_per_trans.png" alt="Sales per Transactions Over Time">
            <h4>Weekly and Hourly Sales Trends</h4>
            <p>Sales do not vary significantly across days of the week, but there is a noticeable peak in sales from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. Peak sales hours (8-10 a.m.) suggest an opportunity to optimize staffing and promotional efforts during these times to leverage higher customer traffic.</p>
            <img src="assets/weekly_trans.png" alt="Weekly Transactions Over Time">
            <img src="assets/daily_trans.png" alt="Daily Transactions Over Time">
            <h3>Multivariate Analysis</h3>
            <p>Purchase volumes for product categories are similar across all three stores. There are no significant differences in product category preferences among stores, indicating uniform demand.</p>
